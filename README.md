Traffic Accident Prediction using Machine Learning


This project aims to develop a Traffic Accident Prediction System that forecasts the likelihood of traffic accidents based on factors such as weather, time, road conditions, traffic density, and driver behavior. The objective is to assist traffic management authorities and emergency services in proactively reducing accidents and enhancing road safety.
